1. Dataset consisting of variables having more than 30% missing values. Let's say out of 50 variables, 6 variables have missing values higher than 30%. How to deal with such scenario.
	
		a. Assign a unique category to missing values, who knows the missing values might decipher some trend.
		b. We can remove them balantly.
		c. We can sesibly check their distribution with the target variable, and if found any pattern we'll keep those missing values and assign thm a new category while removing others.
